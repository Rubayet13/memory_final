Testplan 								Test description 
bulk reset test					Reset for 5 clock cycle to test the default values. 
								
								Result: the default value of reset is changing before the reset is invoked, 
								it might be that the the reset values are depened solely on the clock and not 
								on the reset, the behaviour should have been after the clk reset is invoked, the 
								data should have been reseted at that positive edge clk not before. 
								The changes might or should be in the reset condition of the design code. 
											
bulk write test 				consequetively write for 5 clock cycle to monitor possible changes. 

bulk read test 					consequetively read for 5 clock cycle to monitor possible changes. 
								result: x value is showing , but after reset should have been x
